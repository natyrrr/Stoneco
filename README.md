## StoneCo
*Incorporated: 2012*
Founders: Andre Street and Eduardo Pontes

---

The company was the brainchild of Mr. Street and Mr. Pontes after working both worked in electronic payment and payment processing fields for the larger part of a decade through their online payment technology firm, Braspag. They decided to shut down operations at Braspag even through their success and created Stoneco from the bottom up. The approach differs from their previous company in that they have become more “customer centered” or people oriented versus catering to corporations. 
Their initial firm Braspag, was purchased by Cielo, a Brazilian credit card terminal provider, in 2011 for an undisclosed amount. They used the profits from this sale to initially set up Stoneco back in 2012. After Stoneco launched its initial offering of their IPO, Warren Buffett’s company Berkshire Hathaway purchased 14 million shares at the IPO price of $23 dollars a share, giving them 8% ownership. They also drew other big investors such as China’s Alibaba. 

### Business Activities:

The majority of countries in South America are cash societies due to the lack of bank accounts by the majority of consumers therefore the most merchants do not accept electronic payments, eliminating the need for plastic currency. This is no different in Brazil where 85% of their market is cash. Many Fintech companies have attempted to solve this issue but ultimately the price of credit card terminals and internet service has hindered efforts to allow smaller businesses to become part of this movement leaving only larger businesses able to join.Due to this large disparity in credit card acceptance, most consumers for-go credit cards and even bank accounts all together as ATMs and bank branches are difficult to find therefore making it inconvenient to make everyday purchases.  Currently there are 751 fintech startups in Latin america. Some such have allowed consumers to sign up for pre-paid cards allowing them to make payments domestically and internationally. 
After 10 years in Braspag, the founders of Stoneco saw an opening in the market that could be capitalized on. Stoneco capitalized on this by targeting small and medium size businesses. Business that the average latin american consumer frequently frequents. With a growth of consumers now having access to some form of banking, Stoneco gave these mom and pop shops a chance to compete with larger wealthier businesses.  As of 2018, Stoneco stated they had captured 5.5% of Brazil’s market share and raising that to 9% in 2019. They entered the market offering lower fees than any of the existing providers. They are able to offer smaller fees because they do not have an association or partnership with any bank like many other electronic payment providers. Therefore, allowing them to cut costs to their consumers. By doing this they have aligned themselves to perfectly target consumers that can’t afford the large fees that other electronic payment providers charge. Stoneco targets small to medium size businesses giving these businesses the ability to compete with larger businesses.

## Landscape:

The electronic payment and payment processing sector has come a long way since Western Union developed its electronic fund transfer in the 1870s. In the past 5-10 years we have seen developments and new technologies such as paypal, venmo, and the rise of online banking. The new innovations have made way for consumers to have a more seamless, stress free access to their money. Consumers are able to have better control of their finances therefore having a better grasp and control of their financial future. Before these innovations, consumers had to rely on a middle man to perform tasks that can now be done with a swipe of a finger, they are able to have data at their fingertips to make self informed decisions.
